# Avoid Troubles

The idea is of a multiplayer game to be played on a Samsung Smart TV. Each player is assigned a basket 
to collect the balls falling down. The basket can be moved on the screen by moving the mobile phone. 
Remote sensor values are communicated from the phone to the TV. These values define the motion of the 
basket. Now, the player’s objective is to collect only the balls and avoid other falling items. At the 
beginning of the game, the users will be asked the time duration of the game. When the timer counts 
down to zero, the player with the maximum points wins. Points are awarded for collecting balls and 
deducted for collecting unwanted items.
